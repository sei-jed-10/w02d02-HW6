## HTML & CSS & Responsive Homework Week2 Homework5

# Portfolio

For today's homework, you will practice responsive design by creating your own portfolio website!

Since a lot of people use their phones to check websites, consider how you would want your site to look on smaller screens.

Here's the sections you'll have to include into your page. You can design them however you want. Just make sure they look good for both a larger and a smaller screen!

## Navigation Bar

This will usually include your name/logo and buttons that link to the different sections of your page.

---
## 'About Me'

Anything could go here! Who are you? What's your story? What do you like/dislike? How did your journey get you here? Which Hogwarts house are you?

---
## 'Skills'

Hey, guess what goes under here? CSS and JavaScript are a start! You can add anything else! Are you a good cook? Do you know how to whistle the entire alphabet? Is your LOTR lore knowledge unmatchable?

---
## 'Experiences' or 'Projects'

Projects?? Yes! You going to have Project1 under your belt now. You are a developer, and no one can question it!

---
## Footer

Keep it simple! Your contact information, social icons, and your copyright notice are enough.
